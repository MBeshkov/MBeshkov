### Hi there 👋

I am Mihail and I am continually trying to improve my technical competence through coding challenges whilst regularly participating in workshops and mentoring programs in order to enhance my soft skillset. I do some freelance tutoring on the side and when I have free time, I love to dabble in some (very amateurish) music production.
